    <h1 class="text-center mb-4 fs-2">🌌 Welcome to the State of Inner</h1>
    <p class="text-center mb-4 fs-4 fst-italic">This isn’t just an app. It’s your emotional world — reflected, mapped, and finally understood.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Resurgifi</strong> was born from lived experience — not theory, not textbooks. Just two people: <strong>Kevin Conzo</strong> (addiction, relapse, survival) and <strong>Eileen Lynch</strong> (depression, trauma, healing), building the kind of tool they wish had existed when everything fell apart.</p>

    <p>The name <em>Resurgifi</em> was made up to feel like what it does — help you rise again. Not with pressure or perfection, but with something real. Something cinematic. Something that actually makes you want to come back tomorrow.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 class="fs-3">🗺️ The World Inside</h4>
    <p>Inside Resurgifi lives the <strong>State of Inner</strong> — a fully mapped-out emotional landscape inspired by rehab rooms, mental states, and the battle between light and dark. You’ll meet <em>heroes</em> like Grace, Lucentis, and Velessa… and confront <em>villains</em> like The Crave, The Undermind, and Warden Fall. Each one is a psychological force in your story.</p>

    <p>They’re not just characters. They grow with you. Talk with you. Reflect your journey. The app adapts using cutting-edge AI powered by OpenAI Tier 1 access. And because recovery isn’t linear, Resurgifi tracks your emotional tone — not your streaks.</p>
