  <h1>🌌 Welcome to the State of Inner</h1>
  <p class="mantra">This isn’t just an app. It’s your emotional world — reflected, mapped, and finally understood.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>Resurgifi</strong> was born from lived experience. Not theory. Not textbook psychology. Just two people — <strong>Kevin Conzo</strong> (addiction, relapse, survival) and <strong>Eileen Lynch</strong> (depression, trauma, healing) — deciding to build the kind of tool they wish had existed when everything fell apart.</p>

  <p>They called it <em>Resurgifi</em>, a made-up word that felt like what it was meant to do: help you rise again. Not by forcing productivity or perfection — but by giving people in recovery something real. Something cinematic. Something that actually makes you want to come back tomorrow.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Inside Resurgifi lives the <strong>State of Inner</strong> — a fully mapped-out emotional landscape based on rehab rooms, mental states, and the battle between light and dark. You’ll meet <em>heroes</em> like Grace, Lucentis, and Velessa… and encounter <em>villains</em> like The Crave, The Undermind, and Warden Fall. Each one represents a psychological force in your journey.</p>

  <p>But these aren’t just characters. They grow with you. Talk with you. Mirror your story. As you journal, reflect, and progress, the app adapts using cutting-edge AI powered by OpenAI Tier 1 access. And because recovery isn’t linear, Resurgifi tracks your emotional tone — not your perfection streaks.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>🌀 <strong>Inner Circle</strong> — 5 AI-powered voices respond to you like group therapy, but with character</li>
    <li>📓 <strong>Quests & Reflections</strong> — meaningful journaling designed for relapse-prone days</li>
    <li>🧠 <strong>Auto-Summaries</strong> — get digestible insights about your week, tone, and triggers</li>
    <li>💌 <strong>Wishing Well</strong> — send and receive words of encouragement from your future self</li>
    <li>⚔️ <strong>Hero Chats</strong> — direct emotional support from the hero who fits your fight</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <p>This isn’t about fixing you. It’s about showing you how strong you already are — even when you can’t see it. You’re not weak for being here. You’re wise.</p>

  <p class="mantra"><strong>Resurgifi your life.</strong></p>
