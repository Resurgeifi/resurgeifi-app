intro_text: "It’s Cognita. You’ve been doing more inner lifting than you realize. Today, I want us to face Warden Fall — the one who locks people in cycles of ‘never good enough.’ His prison? Your own expectations. The State of Inner shifts here — stone walls made of shame, echoing memories of things you 'should' have done."
