villain: "Charnobyl"
intro_text: |
  Lucentis here. The villain today is not subtle. Charnobyl doesn’t whisper — he erupts. He waits beneath Skid Row, pulsing with heat, feeding on betrayal, on rage left unspoken.
  
  In the State of Inner, his crater glows when someone bottles too much. I’ll help you see clearly — not just the fire, but the root of it.
video_intro: None

  What anger are you holding that feels too dangerous to speak aloud? Put it here. No judgment.
