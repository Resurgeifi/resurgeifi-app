hero: "Sir Renity"
villain: "Little Lack"
intro_text: |
  Sir Renity, calmly with you. Some threats do not roar. Little Lack waits in the quiet. She pulls you into stillness, then drains you from within.
  
  In the State of Inner, she drifts just outside Sobertropolis. We do not fear her. But we do not linger.
video_intro: None
