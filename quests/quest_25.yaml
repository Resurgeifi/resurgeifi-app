hero: "Velessa"
villain: "Captain Fine"
intro_text: |
  Velessa speaks. You’ve done so much already. But today, we face Captain Fine — the voice that says 'I’m good now' while you’re still bleeding inside.
  
  He haunts the outer edge of the Bridge Between, always polished, always convincing. But I invite you to pause — and feel what still needs tending.
video_intro: None
prompt: |
  Where are you pretending to be okay, just to get through the day? Let stillness reveal what’s real.
