title: "The Storm You Survived"
hero: "Sir Renity"
villain: "Anxia"
intro_text: |
  Sir Renity, standing watch beside you. Today’s storm brews inside — the kind that floods the chest and steals the breath. Her name is Anxia. Her voice is made of spirals.
  
  She rises often in the Quake Rooms, a part of Inner where relapse storms hit hardest. The floor shakes. The air tightens. But here you are — still breathing. Still choosing to face it.
video_intro: None
prompt: |
  What does your anxiety say when it wants to keep you stuck? Speak it, then breathe it out.
