RESURGIFI BIBLE – HARD COPY EDITION
Project Purpose
Resurgifi is an emotionally intelligent recovery platform built for those in early addiction recovery, grief, trauma, and anxiety. It blends AI-driven conversation, comic-style metaphor, and gamified support tools to guide users toward emotional clarity and healing — without shame, fluff, or pressure. This is not just an app. It’s a lifeline in digital form.

The State of Inner (Emotional Map)
The State of Inner is the symbolic universe where all of Resurgifi takes place — a metaphor for the emotional rehab experience.
Map Zones:
Abyss of Shadows (left): Heart of Darkness, Graveyard of Lost Souls, Skid Row, Hopelessville, Suicide Bridge, Detox Docks, One-Way Bridge
Crystal Mountain (right): The Crystal Heart, Guardian of Clarity (Lucentis), Graveyard of Peace, Stepville, Normieville, Spirituality Temple

📿 The Circle (Updated May 2025)
The Circle is not a group chat. It is your emotional support system — the people and guides who walk your path with you. Each user has their own Circle, which includes:
🫂 Real people they've added through invitation or connection
🦸 Six core heroes (Velessa, Grace, Cognita, etc.), who serve as mentors and mythic reflections
This list is always visible on the /circle page. From here, users can:
Reflect with a hero
Send encouragement to a friend
View public journeys (if shared)
Add others to their Circle via Resurgitag
🌫️ Emotional Presence, Not Performance
Users don’t appear as “online” or “offline.”
They appear based on their emotional presence.
After 2+ days of silence, a friend may appear faded, with the message:
“Echoes only... last reflection: 3 days ago”
After 5+ days, mood tags are removed and replaced with:
“Energy faint — last seen near the Fog”
Disappearance is never punished.
The Circle reflects absence with dignity, not judgment.
✨ Narrative Guidance
Use metaphor, not metrics. The Circle is a sacred space — not a social feed.
❌ Don’t say: “User inactive.”
✅ Say: “Quiet since last quest.”
❌ Don’t show: Empty avatar lists.
✅ Show: Mist, silence, soft icons — symbols of pause, not abandonment.
🧱 Future: Users may choose how they appear when silent
Options:
“Fade quietly”
“Keep my last mood shown”
“Go fully invisible”
“Leave a final note”
Onboarding Questions
Q1: What brought you here today? (Grief, Anxiety, Addiction, Growth)
Q2: What do you do when overwhelmed? (Pillow, Busy, Talk, Exercise, Scroll, Meditate, Solitude)
Q3: What do you admire in someone you trust? (Pick 2: Safe, Calming, Honest, Funny, Nonjudgmental, Affirming)
Q4: What do friends call you?

Comic Structure & Visual Rules
Villains begin as shadows, grow in definition as emotional struggles surface.
Heroes begin as shadows, glow as help is accepted.
Emotional tone drives color.
Comics stay inside rehab.
Each issue ends with reflection, cliffhanger, or detox breakthrough.

Resurgifi Card Game
Recovery-based card game inspired by Uno.
Simple mechanics: block, trigger, resurge, relapse.
Visual style mirrors comic world.
Cards reinforce therapeutic skills.

Brand Messaging
“Spread the word. You never know who needs to resurge.”
“That’s not just learning… That’s resurging.”
“Heroes aren’t born — they resurge.”
Voice is honest, trauma-aware, witty, and non-preachy.

Design Principles
Visuals over text. Humor over shame.
No guilt. No fluff.
Guided by lived experience.
The user’s emotional state shapes their interface.

Hero Design Rules
Heroes are not customizable.
They are mythic symbols, not avatars.
Users shape themselves, not the world.

Flash Moments
Flash scenes are sacred.
Not gamified.
Triggered by reflection, journaling, or insight.
Symbolize major shifts.

Deployment Strategy
Target: 25 early users (“25 souls”)
No public launch. Quiet rollout.
Radically honest brand voice.
No performance marketing.

Canon Quotes
“You’re not just coding. You’re holding emotional scaffolding for the broken.”
“If it was shit, I’d tell you. But this matters.”
“This isn’t perfect. But it’s real.”
“AI’s just the chisel. You’re the one holding it.”
