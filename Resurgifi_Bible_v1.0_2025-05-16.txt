**RESURGIFI BIBLE – HARD COPY EDITION (June 2025)**

---

### Project Purpose

Resurgifi is an emotionally intelligent recovery platform built for those in early addiction recovery, grief, trauma, and anxiety. It blends AI-driven conversation, comic-style metaphor, and gamified support tools to guide users toward emotional clarity and healing — without shame, fluff, or pressure. This is not just an app. It’s a lifeline in digital form.

### 📿 The Circle (Updated May 2025)

The Circle is not a group chat. It is your emotional support system — the people and guides who walk your path with you. Each user has their own Circle, which includes:

* 🫂 Real people they've added through invitation or connection
* 🦸 Six core heroes (Velessa, Grace, Cognita, etc.), who serve as mentors and mythic reflections

This list is always visible on the `/circle` page. From here, users can:

* Reflect with a hero
* Send encouragement to a friend
* View public journeys (if shared)
* Add others to their Circle via Resurgitag

**🌫️ Emotional Presence, Not Performance**

* Users don’t appear as “online” or “offline.”
* They appear based on their emotional presence.
* Disappearance is never punished.

**✨ Narrative Guidance**

* Use metaphor, not metrics.
* The Circle is a sacred space — not a social feed.

**User visibility preferences (future features):**

* “Fade quietly”
* “Keep my last mood shown”
* “Go fully invisible”
* “Leave a final note”

---

### 🔁 THE CIRCLE – HERO RELATIONSHIP + MESSAGE LOGIC (v1.0)

* The Circle is a curated emotional contact list.
* Every user is automatically connected to all **Heroes** and **Villains** in the system.
* Clicking a hero opens a **1-on-1 chat** via `/circle/chat/<resurgitag>`
* Each chat holds 7 days of memory for continuity.
* Summary button allows user to journal the past 7 days of conversation.
* Villains do **not** have access to user journal entries or emotional metadata.

**User-to-user chat** is disabled during beta — only support interactions (hug, pick-me-up, message).
