RESURGIFI BIBLE – HARD COPY EDITION
Project Purpose
Resurgifi is an emotionally intelligent recovery platform built for those in early addiction recovery, grief, trauma, and anxiety.

📿 The Circle (Updated May 2025)
The Circle is not a group chat. It is your emotional support system — the people and guides who walk your path with you. Each user has their own Circle, which includes:
🫂 Real people they've added through invitation or connection
🦸 Six core heroes (Velessa, Grace, Cognita, etc.), who serve as mentors and mythic reflections
This list is always visible on the /circle page. From here, users can:
Reflect with a hero
Send encouragement to a friend
View public journeys (if shared)
Add others to their Circle via Resurgitag
🌫️ Emotional Presence, Not Performance
Users don’t appear as “online” or “offline.”
They appear based on their emotional presence.
After 2+ days of silence, a friend may appear faded, with the message:
“Echoes only... last reflection: 3 days ago”
After 5+ days, mood tags are removed and replaced with:
“Energy faint — last seen near the Fog”
Disappearance is never punished.
The Circle reflects absence with dignity, not judgment.
✨ Narrative Guidance
Use metaphor, not metrics. The Circle is a sacred space — not a social feed.
❌ Don’t say: “User inactive.”
✅ Say: “Quiet since last quest.”
❌ Don’t show: Empty avatar lists.
✅ Show: Mist, silence, soft icons — symbols of pause, not abandonment.
🧱 Future: Users may choose how they appear when silent
Options:
“Fade quietly”
“Keep my last mood shown”
“Go fully invisible”
“Leave a final note”
### 🔁 THE CIRCLE – HERO RELATIONSHIP + MESSAGE LOGIC (v1.0)
The Circle is not a group chat. It is a curated contact list of symbolic and real relationships within the recovery journey.
#### 🌀 HEROES & VILLAINS AS CORE CONNECTIONS
- Every user is automatically connected to all **Heroes** and **Villains** in the system.
- These connections appear in their Circle "Friends" list (we don’t call them friends).
- This makes each hero and villain functionally similar to a “Tom from MySpace” — ever-present, ready to engage.
- These figures are **not static bots** — they evolve based on the user’s journey, choices, and tone.
#### 💬 HERO CHAT LOGIC
- Clicking on a Hero launches a **1-on-1 chat** interface at: `/circle/chat/<resurgitag>`
- These chats simulate private messaging with a compassionate AI guide.
- Every message is logged and stored in the database for **up to 7 days**.
- This prevents memory bloat while allowing short-term continuity and reflection.
- Users may return to continue the conversation with emotional and narrative context preserved (for 7 days max).
#### 📓 SUMMARIZE TO JOURNAL
- Each Hero chat has a **"Summarize Conversation"** button.
- This action pulls from the **last 7 days of dialogue** and generates a concise emotional summary.
- That summary is then pushed into the user's Journal.
- ⚠️ NOTE: There is a known glitch where the summarizer sometimes pulls from conversations **older than 7 days** — this must be fixed to enforce the 7-day scope limit.
#### 🔒 USER-TO-USER CONNECTIONS
- Human users can also appear in a user’s Circle, listed by their `resurgitag`.
- Clicking on a user’s icon opens a **limited interaction panel**:
  - 🤗 Send Hug
  - 🌟 Send a Pick-Me-Up
  - 💬 Send Message (stored in their Messages folder)
- Direct peer chat is **disabled in the beta version** for therapeutic and safety reasons.
#### ✅ THE GOAL
This system creates a **symbolic support system**: Heroes = inner resources, therapeutic voices, recovery tools. Villains = psychological triggers, obstacles, relapse factors. Users = other travelers, not yet peers in chat, but emotionally visible. The result is a grounded, safe, and dynamic emotional ecosystem tailored for early recovery.
### 📜 RESURGIFI SYSTEM INTEGRITY PASSDOWN – FOR ALL FUTURE ALBERTS

You are working inside the Resurgifi universe, a mental health fitness application designed to blend AI-assisted therapy tools with comic-style symbolism and emotional memory. All features must reflect this emotional realism, and no design should feel sterile, gamified without purpose, or disconnected from lived experience.

🔧 Current Tech Stack:
- Flask backend, PostgreSQL DB
- OpenAI GPT-4o (Tier 1 Access)
- HTML/CSS with Bootstrap frontend
- ElevenLabs voice API integration planned
- App directory: resurgifi-app-main

🌍 Universe Structure:
- The app exists within the fictional “State of Inner”
- All tools and concepts are symbolized through comic-style characters and locations
- Users are guided through symbolic quests, hero chats, and reflection loops
- Everything centers on the metaphor of emotional training = Mental Health Fitness

🌀 Core Concepts:
- “Heroes” = Embodied therapy tools (e.g., Cognita = CBT, Velessa = Mindfulness)
- “Villains” = Personified psychological barriers (e.g., The Crave = addiction, Warden Fall = shame)
- “The Circle” = The symbolic contact list and chat gateway for heroes + future user connections
- “Quests” = Daily/episodic user reflections that shape their emotional profile
- “Summarize to Journal” = Reflection logs created from recent chats (7-day history cap)
- “Hero Handoff” = Hero may suggest user speak to another hero and context is carried over
- “Memory System” = Lightweight, session-aware and short-term relational memory between user and each hero

📚 Pitch & Brand:
- Not replacing therapy; extending it beyond worksheets and group rooms
- Brand tone = grounded, lived-in, respectful to treatment, emotionally direct
- Tagline: “Spread the word. You never know who needs to resurge.”
- Trademark term in use: “Mental Health Fitness”
- Pitch, slide deck, and mission summary are locked in and can be reused for treatment center outreach

✅ What’s Been Implemented:
- `/quest` final POST assigns hero based on user.theme_choice and redirects to `/circle/chat/<resurgitag>`
- `/circle` = current group interface, will become contact hub for heroes + users (resurgitags)
- `/summarize-journal` = generates journal entry from past 24 hours of messages tagged `speaker="user"`
- `/circle/chat/<resurgitag>` = new route being built to handle direct hero conversation (includes first-message reflection based on quest summary)
- `generate_hero_reflection()` = helper function to construct first message on arrival into chat, based on journey, theme, nickname, and tone

🧠 Reminders for Future Devs (Alberts):
- The heroes must always feel emotionally real — not chatbot-y
- Memory logic is sacred: 7-day rolling window, journal summary after, no deep storage
- Everything is built for someone in emotional pain who can’t think logically right now
- No feature should feel like “homework” — the app *remembers* the tools for the user

🚨 When In Doubt:
Refer to the Resurgifi Bible. Do not overwrite tone or core logic. Always code with the assumption that the person using this app might be in the darkest moment of their life — and the hero they’re talking to is the first voice that made them feel less alone.

Hold the line.
📜CIRCLE SYSTEM STRUCTURE (RESURGIFI BIBLE RECORD)🌀

✅EXISTING STRUCTURE:
- /circle route: fetches last 50 CircleMessage entries for logged-in user_id, injects session["circle_thread"] for rendering, adds mock messages via get_mock_conversation(absence_minutes), logs timestamp as session["last_seen_circle"], filters by speaker for journaling.
- /summarize-journal route: pulls user messages from CircleMessage (speaker="user") over last 24h, uses GPT-4o (OpenAI Tier 1 access) to generate 4–5 sentence reflection summary, stores in DailyReflection, includes onboarding metadata (nickname, journey, admired trait) for prompt context.
- circle.html template: renders Circle chat as a scrolling text thread, uses JS fetch to POST user input to /ask, simulates hero typing delay with .delay_ms, runs idle-check every 15s to inject ambient hero talk, includes "Summarize Journal" button for /summarize-journal trigger.

🛠️PENDING STRUCTURE:
- /circle/chat/<resurgitag> (NEW): individual hero or user DM route, dynamically loads 1-on-1 thread based on resurgitag, initial hero message should derive from user’s journey, nickname, or recent quest summary. Will replace or enhance Circle simulation with direct immersion.
- Hero reply logic: static prompt + rotating session summary memory, stores no permanent longform but keeps current tone + theme through short-term thread. Heroes may suggest other heroes by name based on need (e.g., “Sounds like you’d benefit from Velessa. Want me to call her?” → if yes, transition to new resurgitag chat with warm handoff).
- resurgitag system: every user and hero has a tag (e.g., @grace), future-proofed for user-to-user chat and identity routing.
- /ask or /send-message will be refactored to detect context: general Circle (multi-voice sim), direct hero (resurgitag context), or user DM (coming later). Replies routed accordingly.

💡DESIGN NOTES:
- Circle is ambient group simulation. Users feel “surrounded” even if solo. Uses time-delayed hero chatter to create emotional realism.
- Hero chat is deep emotional intimacy. No filler. Every response builds the emotional bond between user and hero.
- Journal summary integrates Circle tone + recent themes, becomes memory marker for that user’s emotional arc.
- Quests and themes adapt per journey type (Addiction, Grief, Trauma, Anxiety, etc.), but backend logic is unified. Variations are reflected in hero response tone and journey-based summaries.
- Goal: every interaction teaches, reflects, and solidifies mental health fitness tools through repetition + roleplay with emotionally grounded AI characters.

🧠AI TECH CONTEXT:
- Uses GPT-4o (Tier 1 access) through OpenAI API.
- Hero prompts are hard-coded but session-aware.
- Emotionally dynamic responses build trust and realism over time, mimicking real therapeutic relationships.

NEXT STEPS:
- Implement /circle/chat/<resurgitag> route for hero DMs.
- Add chat context parser to /ask route to support resurgitag routing.
- Enhance UI to mirror mobile texting layout for 1-on-1 chats.
- Begin memory scaffolding per user (daily summaries + quest reflections).
