RESURGIFI BIBLE – HARD COPY EDITION
Project Purpose
Resurgifi is an emotionally intelligent recovery platform built for those in early addiction recovery, grief, trauma, and anxiety. It blends AI-driven conversation, comic-style metaphor, and gamified support tools to guide users toward emotional clarity and healing — without shame, fluff, or pressure. This is not just an app. It’s a lifeline in digital form.

Comic Structure & Visual Rules
Villains begin as shadows, grow in definition as emotional struggles surface.
Heroes begin as shadows, glow as help is accepted.
Emotional tone drives color.
Comics stay inside rehab.
Each issue ends with reflection, cliffhanger, or detox breakthrough.

Resurgifi Card Game
Recovery-based card game inspired by Uno.
Simple mechanics: block, trigger, resurge, relapse.
Visual style mirrors comic world.
Cards reinforce therapeutic skills.

Brand Messaging
“Spread the word. You never know who needs to resurge.”
“That’s not just learning… That’s resurging.”
“Heroes aren’t born — they resurge.”
Voice is honest, trauma-aware, witty, and non-preachy.

Design Principles
